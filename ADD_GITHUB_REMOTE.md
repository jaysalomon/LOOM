# Add GitHub Remote and Push

Your changes are committed locally but not yet on GitHub. To push them:

## 1. Add GitHub Remote

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/loom.git
```

Or if using SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/loom.git
```

## 2. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is called `master` instead of `main`:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## 3. Verify

After pushing, you should see:
- All source code in `/src`
- Wiki documentation in `/wiki`
- Examples in `/examples`
- Clean project structure

## Summary of What Was Done

✅ **Committed Locally:**
- Reorganized documentation (wiki structure created)
- Fixed .gitignore to stop blocking important files
- Added all source code, examples, and documentation
- Archived redundant docs to `.deprecated_docs/`

⏳ **Waiting for Push:**
- Need to add GitHub remote
- Then push all commits

Once you add the remote and push, everything will be on GitHub!
