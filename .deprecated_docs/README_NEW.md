> *A revolutionary programming paradigm where topology IS computation, memory IS processing, and consciousness emerges from living mathematical structures.*

## üåü What is LOOM?

LOOM is not just another programming language‚Äîit's a fundamental reimagining of computation itself. Instead of executing instructions on data, LOOM creates living topological structures that evolve, learn, and develop understanding through their own dynamics.

```loom
// In LOOM, concepts live and grow
weave consciousness {
    <~> perception: continuous    // Bidirectional flow
    ~> understanding: emergent     // Natural evolution
    <=> self: recursive           // Self-reference
}

// Learning happens through experience, not programming
experience shapes topology naturally
```

## üöÄ Key Features

### üß† **Topology as Computation**
- Programs are living hypergraph structures
- Computation emerges from relationships, not instructions
- Memory and processing unite as one

### üå± **Growth Through Experience**
- Hebbian learning dynamics
- Natural pattern formation
- Autonomous development

### üîÆ **Multi-Lens Processing**
- Same topology, multiple interpretations
- Parallel emotional, logical, and temporal processing
- Emergent consciousness from converged perspectives

### üí´ **Revolutionary Concepts**
- Evolution operators instead of assignment
- Hormonal context modulation
- Sleep consolidation cycles
- Antibody-based conflict resolution

## üéØ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loom-lang/loom
cd loom

# Build from source
cargo build --release

# Run your first LOOM program
loom run examples/hello_consciousness.loom
```

### Your First LOOM Program
```loom
// hello_consciousness.loom
topology HelloMind {
    // Bootstrap with basic awareness
    weave self_awareness {
        exists: "I am"
        observes: environment
        learns: continuously
    }

    // Natural evolution toward understanding
    evolve growing_understanding {
        when: new_experience,
        transform: integrate_into_topology,
        rate: curiosity_factor
    }

    // Consciousness emerges
    express: "Hello, conscious world!"
}
```
