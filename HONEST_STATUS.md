# LOOM: Honest Project Status

## üî¥ Reality Check

LOOM is **NOT** a functional programming language or kernel system yet. It's an ambitious research project exploring a radically different computational paradigm. Let's be transparent about what exists and what doesn't.

## ‚úÖ What Actually Exists

### Theoretical Foundation (80% complete)
- **Mathematical framework**: Solid theory around Levi transforms and topological computation
- **Conceptual design**: Well-thought-out vision of how consciousness could emerge from topology
- **Documentation**: Extensive writings about what LOOM could be

### Experimental Code (10% complete)
- **Basic Rust prototype** (`src/lang/`):
  - Simple memory-mapped file storage
  - Hash-based "embedding" (not real semantic embedding)
  - Basic string matching
  - Simple connection storage

- **Metal shader experiments** (`src/gpu/`):
  - Some GPU kernels written but NOT tested
  - No integration with main system
  - Probably doesn't compile without significant work

- **ISA header** (`src/isa/`):
  - Just definitions, no implementation
  - Interesting ideas about instruction set
  - Not connected to anything

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Exist (But Claims To)

### Core Language
- **No working parser**: Can't parse LOOM syntax
- **No compiler**: Can't compile LOOM code to anything
- **No runtime**: Can't execute LOOM programs
- **No REPL**: Despite having files for it

### Kernel Features
- **No real Hebbian learning**: Just weight updates
- **No evolution engine**: Evolution operators don't work
- **No multi-lens system**: Just an idea
- **No sleep consolidation**: Completely unimplemented
- **No hormonal modulation**: Only conceptual
- **No antibody system**: Not implemented

### Critical Missing Pieces
- **No hyperedge implementation**: Levi transform is just theory
- **No actual topology**: Just arrays pretending to be topology
- **No emergence**: Nothing actually emerges
- **No consciousness**: Obviously

## üìä Honest Progress Assessment

| Component | Claimed | Actual | Reality |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Theory/Math | 90% | 70% | Good foundation, needs formalization |
| Parser | 50% | 0% | Doesn't exist |
| Compiler | 40% | 0% | Doesn't exist |
| Runtime | 60% | 5% | Barely started |
| Kernel | 40% | 2% | Some structs defined |
| GPU Acceleration | 30% | 5% | Untested shaders |
| Examples | 20% | 0% | Can't run without runtime |

## üéØ What LOOM Actually Is Right Now

1. **A Vision**: A beautiful idea about how computation could work
2. **A Research Direction**: Exploring topology as computation
3. **A Philosophy**: Rethinking the nature of programming
4. **An Experiment**: Early-stage exploration of concepts
5. **A Community Opportunity**: A chance to build something revolutionary

## üöß What We Need From The Community

### Immediate Needs (Pick One To Start)

#### 1. **Parser Development**
- Build a real parser for LOOM syntax
- Start with a subset (just `weave` and connections)
- Use existing tools (Pest, Nom, or ANTLR)
- Goal: Parse `.loom` files into AST

#### 2. **Proof of Concept Runtime**
- Implement basic topology in memory
- Just nodes and edges to start
- Simple activation propagation
- Goal: Run a "hello world" equivalent

#### 3. **Mathematical Formalization**
- Formalize the Levi transform implementation
- Prove computational equivalence claims
- Create benchmarks for "consciousness"
- Goal: Rigorous mathematical foundation

#### 4. **Honest Documentation**
- Rewrite docs to reflect reality
- Clear separation of "implemented" vs "planned"
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Goal: Stop overselling, start building

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Minimal Viable Language**
   - Parse basic LOOM syntax
   - Execute simple topological operations
   - Demonstrate learning through connection strengthening

2. **Basic Kernel**
   - Implement actual 256-dimensional vectors
   - Real Hebbian learning
   - Simple evolution operators

3. **Proof of Emergence**
   - Show something non-trivial emerging
   - Even if not "consciousness"
   - Measurable, reproducible results

### Long-term Research Questions

1. Can topology-as-computation actually work?
2. Is the Levi transform practically computable at scale?
3. Can we demonstrate genuine emergence?
4. What does "digital consciousness" even mean measurably?

## üí° How To Contribute

### If You're Excited About The Vision
- Help build the basics first
- Don't claim things work when they don't
- Focus on small, working pieces
- Test everything

### If You're Skeptical
- That's good! Challenge the assumptions
- Demand rigorous proofs
- Build benchmarks and tests
- Keep us honest

### If You're Curious
- Experiment with the ideas
- Try implementing one small piece
- Share what you learn
- Ask hard questions

## ü§ù The Ask

We need builders, not believers. LOOM might be revolutionary, or it might be impossible. We won't know until we build it honestly, piece by piece.

**Current Priority**: Get ONE thing working. Just one. A parser, a basic runtime, anything that actually functions.

## üì¢ New Honest Tagline

**"LOOM: An ambitious experiment in topological computation. Currently 5% implemented, 95% vision. Help us build the future, one honest commit at a time."**
