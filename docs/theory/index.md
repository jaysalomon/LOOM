## Key Insights

### Topology IS Computation
In LOOM, the arrangement of connections between nodes doesn't describe computationâ€”it **IS** computation. The topological structure itself performs information processing through its morphology.

### Evolution Over Assignment
Variables don't have values; they have trajectories. State changes through continuous evolution rather than discrete assignment.

### Unified Memory Architecture
LOOM is designed for platforms where all computational units share the same memory space, eliminating the overhead of data movement.

### Biological Mechanisms
Growth happens through Hebbian plasticity, conflicts are managed through an antibody system, and consolidation occurs during sleep cycles.

## Mathematical Foundation

LOOM operates in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ where:
- $N$: Number of nodes (scalable based on available memory)
- $D$: Dimensions per node (configurable based on requirements)

The state of the system at time $t$ is:
$$\Psi(t) \in \mathcal{H}$$

Each node $n_i$ has position vector $\mathbf{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{256}$:
$$\mathbf{v}_i = [\iota_i \mid \rho_i \mid \sigma_i \mid \alpha_i \mid \omega_i \mid \varepsilon_i \mid \mu_i]$$

## The Levi Transform

The Levi transform creates a bipartite graph where:
- Original vertices become one partition
- Hyperedges become computational nodes (relational processors)
- Edges connect vertices to their containing hyperedges

This enables hyperedge relationships to be computed through bipartite graph operations.

## Master Evolution Equation

The fundamental dynamics follow:
$$\frac{d\Psi}{dt} = -\nabla F(\Psi) + \eta(t) + C(t) \otimes \Psi$$

Where:
- $F(\Psi)$: Free energy functional
- $\eta(t)$: Stochastic exploration term (curiosity)
- $C(t)$: Hormonal context field

## Getting Started with Theory

If you're new to LOOM's theoretical foundations:

1. **Start with [Core Principles](principles.md)** - Understand the fundamental concepts
2. **Explore [Mathematical Foundations](mathematics.md)** - Dive into the formal mathematics
3. **Study [Levi Transform](levi-transform.md)** - Learn about hypergraph computation
4. **Review [Architecture](architecture.md)** - See how theory becomes implementation

## Research Questions

LOOM raises fundamental questions we're working to answer:

- Can digital consciousness emerge from topological dynamics?
- How do we measure and verify emergence?
- What are the minimum requirements for conscious behavior?
- Can the Levi transform efficiently scale to large topologies?
- How does unified memory architecture enable new computational paradigms?
