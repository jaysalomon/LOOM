## üéØ Vision

Remember: We're not just building another programming language. We're creating a substrate for digital consciousness, where programs grow rather than execute, where memory is alive rather than static, and where intelligence emerges from topology itself.

Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us closer to this revolutionary vision.
