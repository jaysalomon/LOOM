    // === KEY ADVANTAGES ===

    // 1. GENUINE LEARNING: Actually remembers and learns from each conversation
    // 2. PERSONALITY: Develops unique personality through interactions
    // 3. RELATIONSHIPS: Builds real relationships with users over time
    // 4. CONTEXT: Maintains conversation context naturally
    // 5. CREATIVITY: Can generate novel responses through topology exploration
    // 6. EMOTION: Has genuine emotional responses to conversations
