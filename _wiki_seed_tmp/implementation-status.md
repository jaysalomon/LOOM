# Implementation Status

Last Updated: Current Date

## Overview

LOOM is currently **5% implemented**. This page tracks what actually exists vs. what's planned.

## Component Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Working)
- Project structure and organization
- Basic Rust project setup
- Documentation of theory

### üöß In Progress (Partially Working)
- **Memory-mapped storage** (10%)
  - Basic mmap setup exists
  - No actual topology implementation

- **Rust structure** (15%)
  - Boilerplate code exists
  - No functional components

### ‚ùå Not Started (Non-Functional)

#### Core Language
- **Parser**: Cannot parse LOOM syntax
- **Compiler**: Cannot compile to executable form
- **Runtime**: Cannot execute programs
- **REPL**: Exists but doesn't work

#### Topology System
- **Hyperedges**: No Levi transform implementation
- **Node connections**: Just arrays, not real topology
- **Activation propagation**: Non-functional

#### Learning Systems
- **Hebbian learning**: Only weight updates
- **Evolution engine**: Not implemented
- **Sleep consolidation**: Not implemented
- **Hormonal modulation**: Not implemented

#### Advanced Features
- **Multi-lens processing**: Conceptual only
- **Antibody system**: Not implemented
- **Emergence**: Nothing emerges
- **Consciousness metrics**: Not defined

### üìä Progress by Module

| Module | Claimed | Actual | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Theory/Math | 90% | 70% | Good foundation, needs formalization |
| Parser | 50% | 0% | Doesn't exist |
| Compiler | 40% | 0% | Doesn't exist |
| Runtime | 60% | 5% | Basic structure only |
| Kernel | 40% | 2% | Some structs defined |
| GPU | 30% | 5% | Untested Metal shaders |

## Known Issues

1. **Cannot run any .loom files**
2. **No working examples**
3. **Parser is completely missing**
4. **Runtime is just stubs**

## Priority Implementation Tasks

### Immediate (Choose ONE)
1. **Implement basic parser**
   - Just handle `weave` statements
   - Parse to simple AST
   - Location: `src/lang/src/parser.rs`

2. **Create working topology**
   - Simple graph structure
   - Basic node connections
   - Location: `src/lang/src/runtime.rs`

3. **Get REPL working**
   - Execute simple commands
   - Show topology state
   - Location: `src/lang/src/repl.rs`

### Short Term
- Implement Levi transform
- Basic Hebbian learning
- Simple evolution operators

### Long Term
- Multi-lens processing
- GPU acceleration
- Consciousness metrics

## Honest Assessment

**Reality**: LOOM is a research project with strong theoretical foundations but minimal implementation. If you're looking for a working language, this isn't it yet. If you want to help build something revolutionary from the ground up, welcome aboard!
