# LOOM Wiki

Welcome to the LOOM wiki. LOOM is currently ~95% theory and ~5% implementation. The goal here is to help you:

1) Understand the theoretical framework (what LOOM is)
2) Map theory to a concrete implementation plan (how to build it)
3) Use AI coding tools effectively to accelerate development

## Start here

 - Theory overview: read the main paper/source: [LOOM Theory Documentation](../docs/theory/)
- What works vs. what doesn’t: [[implementation-status.md|Implementation Status]]
- Actionable tasks: [[priority-tasks.md|Priority Tasks]]
- Using AI tools with LOOM: [[AI Development Guide]]
- Key terms and definitions: [[Glossary]]
 - Core concept: [[key-insight.md|Hyperedges Are Processors]]

> LOOM is feasible: the theory maps to implementable modules. See [[feasibility-and-roadmap.md|Feasibility & Roadmap]] for milestones and how to help.

## Practical docs

- [[getting-started.md|Getting Started]] — build instructions and current limitations
- [[syntax-reference.md|Syntax Reference]] — core language constructs and EBNF
- [[operators.md|Operators]] — operator definitions and examples
- [[key-insight.md|Key Insight: Hyperedges Are Processors]] — the Levi-transform view that powers LOOM
- [[semantic-contract.md|Semantic Contract]] — syntax-agnostic meaning and update rules
- [[intermediate-representation.md|Intermediate Representation (IR)]] — stable target for any surface syntax
- [[implementation-status.md|Implementation Status]] — honest status, priorities, and gaps
- [[priority-tasks.md|Priority Tasks]] — bite-sized items to pick up
- [[theory-to-implementation.md|Theory → Implementation Map]] — from math to modules
- [[faq.md|FAQ]] — common questions
- [[Glossary]] — core LOOM terminology
