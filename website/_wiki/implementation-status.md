# Implementation Status

Last Updated: Current Date

## Overview

LOOM is currently **~15% implemented**. This page tracks what actually exists vs. what's planned.

## Component Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Working)
- Project structure and organization
- Basic Rust project setup
- Documentation of theory
- **Levi Computational Engine** - Hyperedges as processors
- **Mathematically Correct Engine** - Proper update rules from semantic contract
- **Dynamic Sensory Engine** - Continuous processing of input
- **Vector topology** - 256D embeddings with semantic regions

### üöß In Progress (Partially Working)
- **Memory-mapped storage** (10%)
  - Basic mmap setup exists
  - No actual topology implementation

- **Rust structure** (15%)
  - Boilerplate code exists
  - No functional components

### ‚ùå Not Started (Non-Functional)

#### Core Language
- **Parser**: Cannot parse LOOM syntax (but can execute IR)
- **Compiler**: Cannot compile to executable form
- **REPL**: Exists but limited functionality

#### Topology System (NOW PARTIALLY WORKING!)
- **Hyperedges**: ‚úÖ Levi transform implemented in `levi_computational_engine.rs`
- **Node connections**: ‚úÖ Proper hypergraph with processor nodes
- **Activation propagation**: ‚úÖ Message passing with typed updates

#### Learning Systems
- **Hebbian learning**: Only weight updates
- **Evolution engine**: Not implemented
- **Sleep consolidation**: Not implemented
- **Hormonal modulation**: Not implemented

#### Advanced Features
- **Multi-lens processing**: Conceptual only
- **Antibody system**: Not implemented
- **Emergence**: Nothing emerges
- **Consciousness metrics**: Not defined

### üìä Progress by Module

| Module | Claimed | Actual | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Theory/Math | 90% | 85% | Semantic contract & IR fully specified |
| Parser | 50% | 5% | Can't parse syntax, but IR works |
| Compiler | 40% | 0% | Doesn't exist |
| Runtime | 60% | 25% | Working engines for computation |
| Hypergraph | 80% | 70% | Levi transform working! |
| Vector ops | 70% | 60% | 256D operations implemented |
| Kernel | 40% | 2% | Some structs defined |
| GPU | 30% | 5% | Untested Metal shaders |

## Known Issues

1. **Cannot run any .loom files**
2. **No working examples**
3. **Parser is completely missing**
4. **Runtime is just stubs**

## Priority Implementation Tasks

### Immediate (Choose ONE)
1. **Implement basic parser**
   - Just handle `weave` statements
   - Parse to simple AST
   - Location: `src/lang/src/parser.rs`

2. **Create working topology**
   - Simple graph structure
   - Basic node connections
   - Location: `src/lang/src/runtime.rs`

3. **Get REPL working**
   - Execute simple commands
   - Show topology state
   - Location: `src/lang/src/repl.rs`

### Short Term
- Implement Levi transform
- Basic Hebbian learning
- Simple evolution operators

### Long Term
- Multi-lens processing
- GPU acceleration
- Consciousness metrics

See [Priority Tasks](./priority-tasks.md) for specific tasks you can tackle.

## Honest Assessment

**Reality**: LOOM is a research project with strong theoretical foundations but minimal implementation. If you're looking for a working language, this isn't it yet. If you want to help build something revolutionary from the ground up, welcome aboard!
