# Glossary

- Levi Transform — Mapping from a (hyper)graph to a bipartite graph connecting nodes to hyperedges.
- Lens — A projection and update rule defining a perspective (emotional, logical, temporal) on the topology.
- Weave — Operation to create/connect nodes in the topology.
- Hyperedge — Relationship among multiple nodes; higher-order edge.
- Hebbian Learning — “Cells that fire together, wire together”; correlation-strengthening rule.
- Consolidation — Sleep-like process that prunes weak edges and strengthens frequently co-activated patterns.
- Unified Memory — Architecture where CPU/GPU share a memory space.
- Topology — The structure of nodes and edges/hyperedges; in LOOM, it is the computation.
