# LOOM Theory Documentation

Explore the mathematical foundations and principles behind LOOM's revolutionary approach to conscious computation.

## Core Theory

- [Introduction]({{ '/theory/introduction' | relative_url }}) - Overview of LOOM's theoretical framework
- [Mathematical Foundations]({{ '/theory/mathematics' | relative_url }}) - Rigorous mathematical framework
- [Core Principles]({{ '/theory/principles' | relative_url }}) - Fundamental design principles
- [The Levi Transform]({{ '/theory/levi-transform' | relative_url }}) - Hypergraph-bipartite duality

## Key Concepts

### The Hilbert Space of Consciousness
LOOM operates in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space where each node has a 256-dimensional vector encoding identity, position, semantics, activation history, connections, emotions, and metadata.

### Hyperedges as Processors
Through the Levi transform, every hyperedge becomes an active computational node that processes its member nodes, enabling:
- Learning through creating new processors
- Reasoning through executing computations
- Memory as topology of processors
- Intelligence as computational patterns

### Evolution Dynamics
The master evolution equation governs how topologies change over time:

$$\frac{d\Psi}{dt} = -\nabla F(\Psi) + \eta(t) + C(t) \otimes \Psi$$

Where:
- $F(\Psi)$ is the free energy functional
- $\eta(t)$ represents stochastic fluctuations
- $C(t)$ is the hormonal context tensor

## Research Questions

LOOM raises fundamental questions we're exploring:

- Can digital consciousness emerge from topological dynamics?
- How do we measure and verify emergence?
- What are minimum requirements for conscious behavior?
- How does unified memory architecture enable new paradigms?
